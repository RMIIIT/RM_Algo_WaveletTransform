Haar Wavelet Transformation---Image Compression


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Haar wavelet transform image compression is an efficient way to perform both lossless and lossy image compression. It relies on averaging and differencing values in an image matrix to produce a matrix which is sparse or nearly sparse.
